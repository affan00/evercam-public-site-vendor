            The latest release of SAP MII (officially  launching in January 2015) contains, amongst many other things, the ability to add 3rd party software extensions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Together with <a href="http://www.neoris.com/en/" target="_blank">Neoris</a>, a leading solution extender for MII, we’ve taken advantage of this new feature to enable camera integration.
          </p>
          <p>
            The motto of MII is to give the business owner visibility into his factory floor and what better way to do this than to actually be able to see key events as they happen.
          </p>
          <p>
            By integrating cameras, live views are made available from any Evercam connected Camera.
          </p>
          <p>
            Full details are being made available on the SAP SDN.

            Many thanks to Henry Costa from Neoris and Rajeev Kansal from SAP for their help and support … and best wishes for the SP03 release.
