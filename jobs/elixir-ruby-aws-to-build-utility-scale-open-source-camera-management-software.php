        Evercam wants you to be able to see the people, places, things that you care about anywhere, from any device, at any time. We believe that until now, no one has solved the problem of building good, hardware independent, camera management software.
      </p> 
      <p>
        We’re working to fix that and we’re looking for another developer to join our team.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a thoroughly open source company, you should enjoy producing the sort of code, tests and documentation that inspires others to want to join in and collaborate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since many of our challenges are related to the domain specific requirements of IP Cameras and streaming video, experience in this area would be of great benefit. Do you know ffmpeg? GStreamer ? NGINX-RTMP ? RTSP ?
      </p>
      <p>
        As a platform that should be developer friendly and scale to hundreds of thousands of devices, we’ve opted for Elixir (based on the Erlang VM) and Ruby. We’re really excited about the benefits in terms of robustness and speed brought to us by Elixir and we’d love to work with someone who shares a passion for the beauty of these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Above all, as we find ourselves every day solving new and ever more challenging problems, we’re looking for someone that thrives on delivering practical, pragmatic solutions to hard problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’d like to join the team that has taken it upon themselves to tackle one of the last remaining infrastructural problems of the Internet, we’d love to hear from you. </p>
